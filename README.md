# Election-Analysis
## 1. Overview of Election Audit
  The purpose of this analysis was to inspect election data and report the total amount of votes cast, highlight the candidates and the total votes per candidate, percentage of votes per candidate, and to determine the winning elected official of the race. In being presented with this data in .csv format, we utilized Python to code and create these calculations in a concise and transparent manner. The data visualizations that the analysis is bassed off on, can be seen in the .txt file. We delved even deeper into this data by presenting an elaborate analysis on voter turnout per county, county with the highest turnout, and the percentage of votes in each county from the total count. Adding more refined layers into this analysis was quite a simple task to do due to the high-level and general purpose nature of this programming tool.
